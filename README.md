# 🔁 Synchronous FIFO – Design & Verification using Verilog
Verilog-based design and verification of a parameterized synchronous FIFO with full/empty detection and overflow/underflow handling.

This repository contains the RTL design, testbench, and simulation results for a **Synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** memory buffer, implemented using **Verilog HDL** and tested in **Vivado**.

A FIFO is an essential component in digital systems where **order-preserving, temporary storage** is required — such as data pipelines, communication interfaces, and memory controllers.

## 🔧 FIFO Design Summary

**File:** `fifo.v`  
**Language:** Verilog HDL  
**Top Module:** `sync_fifo`

## 🧱 Design Goals & Highlights

This FIFO design was created with modularity, scalability, and correctness in mind. Key features include:

- 📌 **Clear Module Interface:**  
  All inputs, outputs, and parameters are cleanly defined to ensure smooth integration with other components.

- ⚙️ **Parameterization:**  
  Both FIFO depth and data width are parameterized, making the design easily configurable for different applications.

- 🚦 **Status Flag Control:**  
  Implements logic for `full` and `empty` flags based on read/write pointers, preventing illegal operations.

- 🔁 **Pointer Management:**  
  Carefully manages read and write pointers using circular addressing to efficiently use memory.

- 🔄 **Synchronized Read/Write:**  
  All operations are synchronous, triggered by a common clock for reliable timing and behavior.

- 🛡️ **Robust Error Handling:**  
  Built-in handling for overflow and underflow conditions ensures safe operation during corner cases.

## 🔬 Testbench & Verification

**File:** `fifo_tb.v`  
**Tool:** Vivado Simulator  
**Approach:** Stimulus-based testing with waveform observation

### 🧪 Test Cases:
| Test Case                | Purpose                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Reset Test               | Ensure FIFO resets correctly            |
| Write Test               | Check data write functionality          |
| Read Test                | Check data read functionality           |
| Full Condition           | Validate full flag and block writes     |
| Empty Condition          | Validate empty flag and block reads     |
| Simultaneous R/W         | Test FIFO with both read & write active |
| Alternating R/W          | Verify pointer wrapping behavior        |
| Overflow Test            | Ensure FIFO doesn’t corrupt on overflow |
| Underflow Test           | Ensure safe behavior on underflow       |

Simulation waveforms are saved in `sim/`.
